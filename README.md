# RememberMeExtension

This is a silly one: scans web pages for strings containing "Remember Me" or "Remember Password", and upon finding those, makes the containing element blink to draw attention and plays a snippet of the song "Remember Me" from Pixar's movie "Coco".

## Future Plans

Well, in all probability - none. This was created as a joke for several friends. However, if one were so inclined, one might upgrade it by:

1. Make the scanning method more efficient
2. Support additional languages/"Remember Me" variations
